## Current Progress Summary

### Completed Work

#### 1. Database Architecture
- Designed and implemented a relational database schema with core entities:
  - Books (with metadata like ISBN, title, author, publisher)
  - Book Copies (physical instances with unique call numbers)
  - Students (with matriculation numbers as unique identifiers)
  - Borrowing Records (tracking all lending transactions)
  - Metadata (authors, publishers, categories, languages)
- Established proper relationships between entities with appropriate constraints
- Implemented data validation rules for critical fields

#### 2. API Development
- Developed a RESTful API with the following modules:
http://localhost:8000/docs#/
- Testd most of them using postman(excluding some borrowing records)

#### 3. Business Logic Implementation

  - Loan period rules (2 weeks standard, 1 month maximum)
  - Extension limits (additional 2 weeks allowed)
  - Maximum books per student (3 books limit)
  - Due day reminder(3 day left)
- Implemented borrowing statitic endpoints
